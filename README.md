# QR Scanner
This is a public hosting of QR Scanner, my hardest challenge created for the [2020 NorthSec CTF](https://nsec.io/competition/)

While no one managed to solve it during the CTF, a few teams did get very close. It is a 64-bit [OCaml](https://ocaml.org/) program statically compiled for Linux. Reversing OCaml programs is very different from reversing most other natively-compiled programming languages, so if you've never had the chance to crack an OCaml program before this is for you.
